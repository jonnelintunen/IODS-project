# RStudio Exercise 1

I am **extremely excited** about this course and I'm hoping to learn as much as I can from *data science* and *using R-language*. I am a PhD student in medicine at the University of Eastern Finland and I got the info about this course through our email lists. For my PhD project I have been trying to learn the basics of Python (which I really love) but since this course seemed to be really interesting ~~(eventhough it is using R instead of Python)~~ I decided to jump in and try a new language.
